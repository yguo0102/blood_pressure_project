{{text}}

Please answer if the text reported the mean and standard deviation of blood pressure (BP) values for male alone?       
If yes, answer "bp_male=1"; else answer "bp_male=0"   

Please answer if the text reported the mean and standard deviation of blood pressure (BP) values for female alone?       
If yes, answer "bp_female=1"; else answer "bp_female=0" 

Please answer how many males and females were measured?
Please answer what is the mean and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured on males and females?
Please answer what is the mean and standard deviation of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured on males and females? 
Answer "NA" if the information is not found.

Your answer should be formatted as 
'''
bp_male=[0 or 1]
bp_female=[0 or 1]
N_male=[number]
N_female=[number]
SBP_in_male_mean=[mean]
SBP_in_female_mean=[mean]
SBP_in_male_std=[standard deviation]
SBP_in_female_std=[standard deviation]
DBP_in_male_mean=[mean]
DBP_in_female_mean=[mean]
DBP_in_male_std=[standard deviation]
DBP_in_female_std=[standard deviation]
