Please answer if the content reported the mean and standard deviation of blood pressure values for males and females seperately. 
If no, do not answer the following question and just answer "NA".

If yes, answer the following question.
How many males were measured? 
How many females were measured? 
What is the mean and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured on males?
What is the mean and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured on females? 
What is the mean and standard deviation of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured on males? 
What is the mean and standard deviation of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured on females? 
Answer "NA" if the information is not found.

Your answer should be formatted as 
'''
N_male=[number]
N_female=[number]
SBP_in_male=[mean ± standard deviation]
SBP_in_female=[mean ± standard deviation]
DBP_in_male=[mean ± standard deviation]
DBP_in_female=[mean ± standard deviation]
