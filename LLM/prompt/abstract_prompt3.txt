Read the abstract carefully:

{{abstract}}

Please answer if the abstract reported the mean and deviation of blood pressure values for male and female seperately. 
If no, do not answer the following question and just answer "NA".

If yes, answer the following question.
How many males were measured? 
How many females were measured? 
What is the mean and deviation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured on males?
What is the mean and deviation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured on females? 
What is the mean and deviation of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured on males? 
What is the mean and deviation of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured on females? 
Answer "NA" if the information is not found.

Your answer should be formatted as 
'''
N_male=[number]
N_female=[number]
SBP_in_male=[mean ± standard deviation]
SBP_in_female=[mean ± standard deviation]
DBP_in_male=[mean ± standard deviation]
DBP_in_female=[mean ± standard deviation]
