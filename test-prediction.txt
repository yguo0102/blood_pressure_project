Background O
and O
Purpose— O
Among O
patients O
with O
acute O
stroke, I-Comorbidity
high O
blood O
pressure I-Comorbidity
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
outcome, O
although O
the O
reason O
is O
unclear. O

We O
analyzed O
data O
from O
the O
International O
Stroke O
Trial O
(IST) O
to O
explore O
the O
relationship O
between O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
(SBP), O
subsequent O
clinical O
events O
over O
the O
next O
2 O
weeks, O
and O
functional O
outcome O
at O
6 O
months O
in O
patients O
with O
acute I-Comorbidity
stroke. I-Comorbidity

Methods— O
We O
included O
in O
the O
analysis O
17 O
398 O
patients O
from O
IST O
with O
confirmed O
ischemic I-Comorbidity
stroke. I-Comorbidity

A O
single O
measurement O
of O
SBP O
was O
made O
immediately O
before O
randomization. O

Clinical O
events O
within O
14 O
days O
of O
randomization O
were O
recorded: O
recurrent O
ischemic O
stroke, I-Comorbidity
symptomatic O
intracranial O
hemorrhage, O
death O
resulting O
from O
presumed O
cerebral O
edema, O
fatal O
coronary O
heart I-Comorbidity
disease, I-Comorbidity
and O
death. O

Survival O
and O
dependency O
were O
assessed O
at O
6 O
months. O

Outcomes O
were O
adjusted O
for O
age, O
sex, O
clinical O
stroke I-Comorbidity
syndrome, O
time O
to O
randomization, O
consciousness O
level, O
atrial O
fibrillation, O
and O
treatment O
allocation O
(aspirin, O
unfractionated O
heparin, O
both, O
or O
neither). O

Results— O
A O
U-shaped O
relationship O
was O
found O
between O
baseline O
SBP O
and O
both O
early O
death O
and O
late O
death O
or O
dependency: O
early O
death O
increased O
by O
17.9% O
for O
every O
10 O
mm O
Hg O
below I-SBP
150 I-SBP

3.8% O
for O
every O
10 O
mm O
Hg O
above I-SBP
150 I-SBP
mm I-SBP
Hg I-SBP
(P=0.016). O

The O
rate O
of O
recurrent O
ischemic I-Comorbidity
stroke I-Comorbidity
within O
14 O
days O
increased O
by O
4.2% O
for O
every O
10–mm O
Hg O
increase O
in O
SBP O
(P=0.023); O
this O
association O
was O
present O
in O
both O
fatal O
and O
nonfatal O
recurrence. O

Death O
resulting O
from O
presumed O
cerebral O
edema O
was O
independently O
associated O
with O
high O
SBP O
(P=0.004). O

No O
relationship O
between O
symptomatic O
intracranial O
hemorrhage O
and O
SBP O
was O
seen. O

Low O
SBP O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
severe O
clinical O
stroke I-Comorbidity
(total O
anterior O
circulation O
syndrome) O
and O
an O
excess O
of O
deaths O
from O
coronary I-Comorbidity
heart I-Comorbidity
disease I-Comorbidity
(P=0.002). O

Conclusions— O
Both O
high O
blood O
pressure O
and O
low O
blood O
pressure O
were O
independent O
prognostic O
factors O
for O
poor O
outcome, O
relationships O
that O
appear O
to O
be O
mediated O
in O
part O
by O
increased O
rates O
of O
early O

and O
death O
resulting O
from O
presumed O
cerebral O

in O
those O
with O
low O

The O
occurrence O
of O
symptomatic O

Background— O
The O

seen O
a O
considerable O

We O
present O
a O
review O

which O
included O
>188 O

participants O
and O
approximately O
6800 O
stroke I-Comorbidity
events. O

Cohort O

now O
indicate O
that O

of O
approximately O
one O
third O
in O
subjects O
aged O
60 I-Age

The O

is O
consistent O
across O

and O
stroke I-Comorbidity
subtypes O
and O
for O
fatal O
and O

The O
proportional O

but O
is O
still O
a O
strong O
and O
positive O
association O
in O
those O

Data O
from O
randomized O
controlled O
trials, O
in O
which O
mean O
age O
at O
event O
was O
approximately O
70 O
years, O
indicate O
that O
a O

in O
systolic O
BP O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
reduction O
in O
risk O
of O
stroke I-Comorbidity
of O
approximately O
one O
third. O

Per O
mm O
Hg O
systolic O
BP O
reduction, O
the O
benefits O
for O
stroke I-Comorbidity
appear O
similar O
between O
agents, O
by O
baseline O
BP O
levels, O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
individuals O
have O
a O
past O

disease. I-Comorbidity

There O
is, O
however, O
evidence O
of O
greater O
benefit O
with O
a O
larger O
BP O
reduction. O

Conclusions— O
The O
epidemiologically O
expected O
benefits O
of O
BP O
lowering O
for O
stroke I-Comorbidity
risk O
reduction O
are O
broadly O
consistent O
across O
a O
range O
of O
different O

There O
are O
greater O
benefits O
from O
larger O
BP O
reductions, O
and O
initiating O
and O
maintaining O
BP O
reduction O
for O
stroke I-Comorbidity

is O
a O
more O
important O
issue O
than O
choice O
of O

Our O

reduce O
the O

the O

Key O
Points O
There O
is O
growing O
evidence O
that O
the O
CNS O
contributes O
to O
the O
development O
and O
maintenance O
of O
many O
forms O
of O
human O
hypertension. I-Comorbidity

The O
disease O
is O
typically O
associated O
with O
an O
elevated O
sympathetic O
nerve O
activity O
(SNA) O
and O
is O
often O
satisfactorily O
controlled O
by O
sympatholytic O
drugs. O

The O
mechanism O
by O
which O
SNA O
elevates O
resting O
blood O
pressure O
(BP) O
is O
not O
completely O
understood, O
but O
is O
thought O
to O
involve O
a O
resetting O
of O
the O
renal O
barostat O
(relationship O
between O
BP O
and O
sodium O
excretion). O

Several O
subsets O
of O
sympathetic O
efferent O
regulate O
the O
circulation. O

The O
efferents O
that O
are O
most O
crucial O
to O
BP O
control O
are O
tonically O
active O
at O
rest, O
and O
their O
defining O
property O
is O
a O
powerful O
feedback O
inhibition O
of O
arterial O
baroreceptor O
origin O
(barosensitive O
efferents). O

These O
sympathetic O
efferents O
respond O
in O
parallel O
fashion O
to O
many O
stimuli O
but O
can O
also O
be O
differentially O
regulated O
according O
to O
their O
visceral O
target O
(for O
example, O
the O
heart O
versus O
the O
kidney). O

Barosensitive O
efferents O
are O
recruited O
to O
raise O
BP O
and O
cardiac O
output O
in O
keeping O
with O
behaviour, O
but O
their O
mean O
level O
of O
activity O
at O
rest O
probably O
has O
the O
greatest O
influence O
on O
the O
24-h O
average O
BP O
level. O

This O
basal O
activity O
is O
generated O
by O
a O
network O
of O
brainstem O
and O
hypothalamic O
neurons O
that O
converge O
at O
several O
crucial O
nodal O
points O
— O
the O
nucleus O
of O
the O
solitary O
tract O
(NTS), O
the O
rostral O
ventrolateral O
medulla O
(RVLM) O
and O
the O
paraventricular O
nucleus O
of O
the O
hypothalamus O
(PVH). O

This O
network O
is O
regulated O
by O
somatic O
and O
visceral O
sensory O
afferents O
and O
by O
blood-borne O
factors O
(for O
example, O
sodium, O
oxygen, O
hormones O
and O
cytokines), O
osmolality O
and O
pH. O

These O
influence O
selected O
populations O
of O
neurons O
via O
circumventricular O
organs, O
transendothelial O
coupling O
or O
by O
simple O
diffusion. O

The O
RVLM O
contains O
adrenergic O
and O
other O
neurons O
that O
are O
the O
principle O
source O
of O
excitatory O
drive O
to O
the O
barosensitive O
sympathetic O
preganglionic O
neurons. O

These O
neurons O
have O
a O
key O
role O
in O
short-term O
BP O
stabilization O
via O
the O
baroreflex, O
and O
in O
coordinating O
the O
circulation O
with O
respiration. O

The O
PVH O
also O
regulates O
the O
basal O
activity O
of O
barosensitive O
sympathetic O
efferents O
via O
parvocellular O
neurons O
that O
project O
to O
the O
RVLM, O
the O
NTS O
and O
the O
spinal O
cord. O

These O
neurons O
are O
especially O
important O
in O
the O
context O
of O
blood O
volume O
and O
regulation O
of O
sodium O
concentrations. O

Sympathetic O
nerve O
hyperactivity O
is O
commonly O
mediated O
by O
an O
elevated O
discharge O
of O
the O
sympathoexcitatory O
neurons O
located O
in O
the O
RVLM O
and O
PVH, O
but O
the O
root O
cause O
of O
these O
changes O
can O
be O
remote. O

For O
example, O
increased O
SNA O
and O
neurogenic O
hypertension O
can O
be O
caused O
by O
dysfunction O
of O
sensory O
afferents, O
such O
as O
chemoreceptors, O
baroreceptors O
and O
renal O
afferents, O
inappropriately O
high O
concentrations O
of O
hormones O
that O
regulate O
blood O
volume O
and O
sodium O
concentration O
via O
the O
hypothalamus–sympathetic O
nervous O
system O

Abstract O
Hypertension I-Comorbidity
— O
the O
chronic O
elevation O
of O
blood O
pressure O
— O
is O
a O
major O
human O
health O
problem. O

In O
most O
cases, O
the O
root O
cause O
of O
the O
disease O
remains O
unknown, O
but O
there O
is O
mounting O
evidence O
that O
many O
forms O
of O
hypertension I-Comorbidity
are O
initiated O
and O
maintained O
by O
an O
elevated O
sympathetic O
tone. O

This O
review O
examines O
how O
the O
sympathetic O
tone O
to O
cardiovascular O
organs O
is O
generated, O
and O
discusses O
how O
elevated O
sympathetic O
tone O
can O
contribute O
to O
hypertension. I-Comorbidity

Abstract O
A O
primary O
role O
for O
the O
kidney O
in O
the O
initiation O
and O
maintenance O
of O
hypertension I-Comorbidity
has O
long O
been O
recognized, O
but O
the O
pathogenetic O
interactions O
among O
renal O
hemodynamics, O
hormonal O
and O
hereditary O
factors, O
and O
dietary O
sodium O
intake O
remain O
enigmatic. O

Reduction O
in O
filtration O
surface O
area, O
whether O
acquired O
in O
the O
course O
of O
intrinsic O
renal O
disease O
or O
after O
surgical O
renal O
ablation, O
leads O
to O
systemic O
hypertension I-Comorbidity
as O
well O
as O
to O
progressive O
renal O
insufficiency, O
sequellae O
made O
even O
more O
severe O
by O
dietary O
sodium O
excess. O

Moreover, O
hypertension I-Comorbidity
and O
progressive O
renal O
disease O
eventuate O
in O
some O
individuals O
born O
with O
a O
solitary O
kidney, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
those O
with O
more O
severe O
degrees O
of O
dysgenesis O
(ie, O
oligomeganephronia). O

Hypertension I-Comorbidity
is O
also O
commonly O
observed O
in O
certain O
inbred O
rat O
strains O
in O
which O
filtration O
surface O
area O
is O
congenitally O
deficient. O

Based O
on O
these O
and O
other O
lines O
of O
evidence O
reviewed O
herein, O
we O
postulate O
that O
a O
renal O
abnormality O
that O
contributes O
to O
essential O
hypertension I-Comorbidity
in O
the O
general O
population O
is O
a O
reduced O
number O
of O
nephrons. O

The O
consequences O
of O
this O
abnormality O
are O
limitations O
in O
the O
ability O
to O
excrete O
sodium O
and O
thus, O
salt-sensitive O
hypertension. O

Finally, O
congenital O
variability O
in O
filtration O
surface O
area O
may O
explain O
why O
only O
some, O
but O
not O
all, O
patients O
exposed O
to O
potentially O
injurious O
renal O
stimuli O
eventually O
manifest O
chronic O
nephropathy. O

This O
may O
also O
account O
for O
the O
susceptibility O
of O
subsets O
of O
Type O
I O
and O
Type O
II O
diabetics O
to O
develop O
overt O
glomerulopathy. O

are O
relatively O
new O
to O

Abstract O
High O
blood O
pressure O
(BP) O
or O
hypertension I-Comorbidity
is O
the O
single O
most O
crucial O
adjustable O
risk O
factor O
for O
cardiovascular I-Comorbidity
diseases I-Comorbidity
(CVDs) O
and O
monitoring O
the O
arterial O
blood O
pressure O
(ABP) O
is O
an O
efficient O
way O
to O
detect O
and O
control O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
cardiovascular O
health O
of O
patients. O

Therefore, O
monitoring O
the O
regulation O
of O
BP O
during O
patients’ O
daily O
life O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
the O
ambulatory O
setting O
and O
the O
latest O
mobile O
health O
technology. O

In O
recent O
years, O
many O
studies O
have O
been O
conducted O
to O
explore O
the O
feasibility O
and O
performance O
of O
such O
techniques O
in O
the O
health O
care O
system. O

The O
ultimate O
aim O
of O
these O
studies O
is O
to O
find O
and O
develop O
an O
alternative O
to O
conventional O
BP O
monitoring O
by O
using O
cuff-less, O
easy-to-use, O
fast, O
and O
cost-effective O
devices O
for O
controlling O
and O
lowering O
the O
physical O
harm O
of O
CVDs I-Comorbidity
to O
the O
human O
body. O

However, O
most O
of O
the O
current O
studies O
are O
at O
the O
prototype O
phase O
and O
face O
a O
range O
of O
issues O
and O
challenges O
to O
meet O
clinical O
standards. O

This O
review O
focuses O
on O
the O
description O
and O
analysis O
of O
the O
latest O
continuous O
and O
cuff-less O
methods O
along O
with O
their O
key O
challenges O
and O
barriers. O

Particularly, O
most O
advanced O
and O
standard O
technologies O
including O
pulse O
transit O
time O
(PTT), O
ultrasound, O
pulse O
arrival O
time O
(PAT), O
and O
machine O

are O
investigated. O

The O
accuracy, O
portability, O
and O
comfort O
of O
use O
of O
these O
technologies, O
and O
the O
ability O
to O
integrate O
to O
the O
wearable O

system O
are O
discussed. O

Finally, O
the O
future O
directions O
for O

study O
are O
suggested. O

Inaccurate O
BP O

is O
a O

has O
outlined O
the O
technical O

The O
report O
is O
applicable O
to O
ambulatory, O

devices O
used O
for O
clinical O
purposes. O

The O
report O
recommends O
that O
for O
routine O
clinical O
purposes, O
(1) O
automated O
devices O
be O
used, O
(2) O
an O

and O
(3) O
that O
only O

(eg, O
the O
International O
Organization O
for O

protocol) O
be O
used. O

Accurate O
measurement O
also O
depends O
on O
standardized O
patient O
preparation O
and O
measurement O
technique O
and O
a O
quiet, O
comfortable O

taken O
to O
implement O
the O

and O
to O

(1816-1895). O

As O
one O
of O
the O
most O
remarkable O
scientists, O
Ludwig O
invented O
the O
kymograph, O
which O
for O
the O
first O
time O
enabled O
the O
recording O
of O
continuous O
blood O

(BP), O
opening O
the O
door O
to O
the O
modern O
study O
of O

Almost O
a O
century O
later, O
intraarterial O
BP O
monitoring O
through O
an O
arterial O
line O
has O
been O
used O
clinically. O

Subsequently, O
arterial O

and O
volume O

method O
were O
developed O
and O
applied O
in O
continuous O
BP O
measurement O
in O
a O

In O
the O

been O
made O
to O
transform O
the O
method O

Significance O
The O
present O
work O
examines O
beliefs O
associated O
with O
racial O
bias O
in O
pain O
management, O
a O
critical O
health O
care O
domain O
with O
well-documented O
racial O
disparities. O

Specifically, O
this O
work O
reveals O
that O
a O
substantial O
number O
of O
white I-Race
laypeople O
and O
medical O
students O
and O
residents O
hold O
false O
beliefs O
about O
biological O
differences O
between O
blacks I-Race
and O
whites I-Race
and O
demonstrates O
that O
these O
beliefs O
predict O
racial O

in O
pain O

and O

recommendation O
accuracy. O

It O
also O
provides O
the O
first O
evidence O
that O
racial O

is O

Taken O
together, O
this O
work O
provides O
evidence O
that O
false O
beliefs O
about O
biological O

between O
blacks I-Race
and O
whites I-Race
continue O
to O
shape O
the O
way O
we O
perceive O

treat O
black I-Race
people—they O
are O
associated O
with O
racial O

Abstract O
Black I-Race
Americans I-Race
are O
systematically O
undertreated O
for O
pain O
relative O
to O
white I-Race
Americans. I-Race

We O
examine O
whether O
this O
racial O
bias O
is O
related O
to O
false O
beliefs O
about O
biological O
differences O
between O
blacks I-Race
and O
whites I-Race
(e.g., O
“black O
people’s O
skin O
is O
thicker O
than O
white I-Race
people’s O
skin”). O

Study O
1 O
documented O
these O
beliefs O
among O
white I-Race
laypersons O
and O
revealed O
that O
participants O
who O
more O
strongly O
endorsed O
false O
beliefs O
about O
biological O
differences O
reported O
lower O
pain O
ratings O
for O
a O
black O
(vs. O

white) O
target. O

Study O
2 O
extended O
these O
findings O
to O
the O
medical O
context O
and O
found O
that O
half O
of O
a O
sample O
of O
white I-Race
medical O
students O
and O
residents O
endorsed O
these O
beliefs. O

Moreover, O
participants O
who O
endorsed O
these O
beliefs O
rated O
the O
black O
(vs. O

white) O
patient’s O
pain O
as O
lower O
and O
made O
less O
accurate O
treatment O
recommendations. O

Participants O
who O
did O
not O
endorse O
these O
beliefs O
rated O
the O
black O
(vs. O

white) O
patient’s O
pain O
as O
higher, O
but O
showed O
no O
bias O
in O
treatment O
recommendations. O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
individuals O
with O
at O
least O
some O
medical O
training O
hold O
and O
may O
use O
false O
beliefs O
about O
biological O
differences O
between O
blacks I-Race
and O
whites I-Race
to O
inform O
medical O
judgments, O
which O
may O
contribute O
to O
racial O
disparities O
in O
pain O
assessment O
and O
treatment. O

Assessment O
of O

is O
an O
important O
measure O

on O

However, O

have O
come O
under O

over O
the O

Professional O

have O
actively O

with O
the O

A O
known O

of O
the O

is O
that O
patients O
with O
darker O

(compared O

are O
more O
likely O
to O
experience O
occult O

The O

by O
Dr O

was O
a O
retrospective O

using O
a O

from O

Using O

the O

into I-Race

Dr O

reported O
higher O
rates I-Location

Using O
underdetection O

to O
assess O
the O
consequences O
of O

was O
a O

A O

similarly O
demonstrated O

stand: O
(1) O
Why O
has O
this O
racial O
and O
ethnic O
discrepancy O
in O
the O
accuracy O
of O
commonly O
used O
pulse O
oximetry O
not O
been O
addressed? O

(2) O
How O
should O
clinicians O
respond O
given O
the O
increased O
awareness O
of O
the O
problem O
and I-Age
some I-Age
of O
its O
ramifications? O

Historical O

of O
patients O
of O
racial O
and O
ethnic O
minoritized O
groups O
and O
a O
diminished O
concern O
for O
their O
health O
outcomes O
may O
explain O
in O
part O
why O
this O
phenomenon—differential O
pulse O
oximetry O
accuracy—has O
been O
recognized O
for O
more O
than O
30 O
years10 O
and O
has O
not O
been O
corrected. O

Using O
White O
patients O
as O
the O
standard O
in O
biomedical O

has O
led O
to O
both O
differential O
care O
and O
innovation O
inertia O
for O
optimizing O
the O
way O
devices O
and O
algorithms O

for O
patients O
of O
racial O
and O
ethnic O
minoritized O
groups.11 O
The O
economics O
associated O
with O
ignoring O
the O
issue O
cannot O
be O
excluded O
from O
this O
discussion. O

Hospitals O
and O
practitioners O
continue O
to O
buy O
and O
use O
these O
devices O
despite O
their O
inaccuracy O
for O
non-White O
patients. O

The O
observation O
that O
designing O
a O
new O
device O
and O
exchanging O
millions O
of O
machines O
in O
hospitals O
and O
clinics O

the O
country O
may O
be O
deemed O
unpopular O
could O
suggest O
that O
racial O
equity O
in O
patient O
care O
is O
not O
something O
these O
institutions O
are O
willing O
to O
pay O
for—or O
at O
least O
not O
enough O
of O
a O
priority O
to O
insist O
on O
devices O
that O
work O
equitably. O

Similarly, O
changing O
this O
injustice O
paradigm O
presents O
a O
challenge O
for O

in O
part O
because O
of O
the O
passivity O
of O
medical O
education—students O
of O
medicine O
are O
taught O
how O
the O
system O
works, O
not O
how O
to O
change O
it.12 O
There O
is O
no O
single O
easy O
solution O
to O
the O

of O
pulse O
oximetry’s O
racial O
and O
ethnic O
bias. O

Although O
an O
easy O
bedside O
adjustment O
for O

measurement O
disparity O
is O
an O
attractive O
idea, O
there O
is O
no O
proven O
approach O
because O
of O
the O
noise O
and O
variable O
bias O
of O
the O
currently O
available O
devices. O

Interestingly, O
the O
design O
flaws O
of O
the O
pulse O
oximeter O
have O
been O
corrected O
in O
some O
devices. O

These O
improved O
devices O
use O
more O
wave O
lengths O
of O
light O

perform O
equally O
for O
different O
skin O
tones; O
they O
have O
been O

in O
limited O
settings O
but O
have O
not O
been O
widely O
produced O
or O
distributed.1 O
The O
next O
generation O
of O
oxygen O
monitors O
should O
be O
designed O
and O
tested O
to O
work O
equally O
on O
all O
patients. O

However, O
this O

an O
unlikely O
scenario O
without O
market O
pressure. O

Hospital O
systems, O
medical I-Comorbidity
practitioners, O
and O
regulatory O
entities O
need O
to O
press O
for O
regulatory O
scrutiny O
and O
design O
equity O
by O
limiting O
purchasing O
choices O
to O
devices O

equal O
performance O
for O
patients O
of O
all O
skin O
tones. O

In O
the O
meantime, O
a O
clinical O
strategy O
for O
avoiding I-Comorbidity
undertreating O
hypoxia O
in O
patients O
with O

skin O
is, O
unfortunately, O
lowering O
the O
threshold O
for O
suspected O
disease O
and O
obtaining O
more O
arterial O
blood I-Comorbidity
gases. O

Ultimately, O
pulse O
oximetry O
is O
a O

measure O
of O
blood O
arterial O
saturation, O
which O
is O
connected O
to O
tissue O
hypoxia O
through O
oxygen O
delivery O
and O
uptake. O

There O
are O
multiple O
clinical O
trends O
that O
can O
be O
used O
to O
globally O
assess O
tissue O
hypoxia O
in O
patients O
with O
an O
array O
of O
illnesses. O

Increasing I-Comorbidity
invasive O
testing, O
such O
as O

blood O
gases, O
puts O
patients O
of O
racial O
and O
ethnic O
minoritized O
groups O
at O
higher O
risk O
of O
rare O
but O
possible O
complications, O
as O
well O
as O
physical O
pain, O
but O
these O
need O
to O
be O
balanced O
against O
the O
risks O
of O
hypoxemia, O
which O
are O
not O
uncommon. O

Although O
differences O
in O
pulse O
oximetry O
may O

to O
be O
most O
meaningful O
near O
treatment O
thresholds, O
certain O
patient O
populations O
(ie, O
Black O
patients O
undergoing O
extracorporeal O
membrane O
oxygenation O
for O
acute O
respiratory O
distress O
syndrome) O
have O
high O
rates O
of O
occult O

indicating O
a O
need O
for O
greater O
awareness O
when O
treating O
these O
groups. O

Moreover, O
with O
children, O
even O
mild O
occult O
hypoxemia O
can O
have O
substantial O
long-term O
effects.5 O
Why O
tolerate O
a O
device O
that O
consistently O
works O
less O
well O
in O
patients O
with O

skin O
tones? O

Additionally, O
the O
association O
of O
underdetection O
of O
occult O
hypoxemia O
with O
treatment O
delay O
cannot O
be O
disassociated O
from O
the O
multilevel O
injustices O
and O
persistent O
disparities O
underlying O
the O
worse O
COVID-19 O
outcomes O
experienced O
by O
patients O
of O
racial O
and O
ethnic O
minoritized O
groups. O

These O
larger O
and O
systemic O
issues O
exist O
outside O
of O

design O
issues O
demonstrated O
by O
these O
investigations.7Although O
the O
device O
measurement O
error O
is O
real O
and O
based O
purely O
on O
optics, O

decision O
to O
do O
nothing O
about O
a O
faulty O
device O
is O
a O
human O
one, O
and O
one O
that O
can O
and O
should O
be O
corrected. O

At O
a O

score, O
Black O
patients O
are O
considerably O
sicker O
than O
White O
patients, O
as O
evidenced O
by O

of O

Remedying O
this O

would O
increase O
the O
percentage O
of O
Black O
patients O
receiving O

help O
from O
17.7 O
to O
46.5%. O

The O
bias O
arises O
because O
the O
algorithm O
predicts O
health O
care O
costs O
rather O
than O
illness, O
but O
unequal O
access O
to O

means O
that O
we O
spend O
less O
money O
caring O
for O
Black O
patients O
than O
for O
White O

Thus, O
despite O
health O
care O
cost O
appearing O
to O
be O
an O

proxy O
for O
health O
by O
some O
measures O
of O

large O
racial O
biases O
arise. O

We O
suggest O
that O
the O
choice O

seemingly O

proxies O
for O

can O
be O
an O
important O

of O

in O

The O

However, O
such O

Measurement O
of O
arterial O
pressure O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
basic O

of O
patient O
management. O

Arterial O
pressure O
is O
determined O
by O
the O
volume O
ejected O
by O
the O
heart O
into O
the O
arteries, O
the O

of O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
arteries, O
and O
the O
rate O
at O
which O
the O
blood O
flows O
out O
of O
the O
arteries. O

This O
review O
will O
discuss O
the O
three O
forces O
that O
determine O
the O
pressure O
in O

vessel: O
elastic, O
kinetic, O
and O
gravitational O
energy. O

Emphasis O
will O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
distribution O
of O
arterial O
resistances, O
the O
elastance O
of O
the O
walls O

the O
large O
vessels, O
and O
critical O
closing O
pressures O
in O
small O
arteries O
and O
arterioles. O

Regulation O
of O
arterial O
pressure O
occurs O
through O
changes O
in O
cardiac O
output O
and O
changes O
in O

resistance, O
but O
these O
two O
controlled O
variables O
can O
sometimes O
be O
in O
conflict. O

Assessing O
the O
pulse O
is O
a O
common O
procedure O
and O
an O
important O
aspect O
of O
many O
nursing O
interventions; O

should O
always O
be O
done O
with O
care O
and O
reassessed O
as O
needed. O

Assessment O
should O
always O
be O
taken O
seriously, O
with O
any O

from O
the O
norm O
reported O
to O
a O
senior O
clinician, O
and O
pulse O
rate, O
rhythm O
and O
strength O

always O
be O
documented. O

Pulses O
indicate O
numerous O
patient O
characteristics O
including O
the O
degree O
of O
relaxation, O
regularity O

cardiac O
contractions O
and O
sufficiency O
of O
cardiac O
output. O

This O
article O
considers O
the O
relevant O
anatomy, O
physiology O
and O
practice O
of O
pulse O

and O
recording. O

Vital O
signs O
are O
an O
objective O
measurement O
of O
the O
essential O
physiological O
functions O
of O
a O

organism. O

They O
have O
the O
name O
"vital" O
as O
their O
measurement O
and O
assessment O
is O
the O
critical O
first O
step O
for O
any O
clinical O
evaluation. O

The O
first O
set O
of O
clinical O
examinations O
is O
an O
evaluation O
of O

vital O
signs O
of O
the O
patient. O

Triage O
of O
patients O
in O
an O
urgent/prompt O
care O
or O
an O
emergency O
department O
is O
based O

their O
vital O
signs O
as O
it O
tells O
the O
physician O
the O
degree O
of O
derangement O
that O
is O
happening O
from O
the O
baseline. O

Healthcare O
providers O
must O
understand O
the O
various O
physiologic O
and O
pathologic O
processes O
affecting O
these O
sets O
of O
measurements O
and O
their O
proper O
interpretation. O

If O
we O
use O
a O
triage O
method O
where O
we O
select O
patients O
without O
determining O
their O
vital O
signs, O
it O
may O
not O
give O

a O
reflection O
of O
the O
urgency O
of O
the O
patient's O
presentation.[1] O
The O
degree O
of O
vital O
sign O

may O
also O
predict O
the O
long-term O
patient O
health O
outcomes, O
return O
emergency O
department O
visits, O
and O
frequency O
of O
readmission O
to O
hospitals, O
and O
utilization O
of O
healthcare O
resources. O

Traditionally, O
the O
vital O
signs O
consist O
of O
temperature, O
pulse O
rate, O
blood O
pressure, O
and O
respiratory O
rate. O

Even O
though O
there O
are O
a O
variety O
of O
parameters O
that O
may O
be O
useful O
along O
with O
the O
traditional O
four O
vital O

parameters, O
studies O
have O
only O
found O
pulse O
oximetry O
and O
smoking O
status O
to O
have O
significance O
in O
patient O
outcomes.[2] O
Pulse O
oximetry O
sometimes O
helps O
to O

the O
patient's O
physiological O
functions, O
which O
would O
sometimes O
be O
unclear O
by I-Location
checking I-Location
just O
the O
traditional O
vital O
signs. O

The O
inclusion O

smoking O
status O
has O
the O
premise O
that O
the O
patient O
will O
be O
provided O
counseling O
by O
the O
provider O
on O
quitting O


In O
the O
past, O
some O
health O
care O
systems O
in O
the O
United O
States O
had O
used O
"pain O
as O
the O
fifth O
vital O
sign'. O

This O
approach O
is O
being O
abandoned O

to O
the O
unintended O
opioid O
crisis O
that O
the O
country O
is O
currently O
facing.[3] O

Pathophysiologic O
changes O
in O
the O
blood O
vessels O
are O
associated O
with O
a O

variety O
of O
cardiovascular O
events, O
but O
our O
ability O
to O
assess O
vascular O
structure O
and O
function O
are O
limited. O

Although O
arteriography O
provides O
some O
information O
regarding O
intimal O
pathology, O
it O
provides O
little O
information O
about O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
arterial O
wall O
or O
its O
physiology. O

A O
reduction O
in O
arterial O
compliance O
has O
long O
been O
regarded O
as O
a O
potentially O
useful O
indicator O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
arterial O
disease.1 O
Changes O
in O
the O

wall O
leading O
to O
reductions O
in O
arterial O
compliance O
may O
precede O
the O
onset O
of O

apparent O
disease, O
and O
may O
identify O
individuals O
at I-Comorbidity

before I-Comorbidity
disease O

(symptoms O
due O

are, O
in O
general, O
late O
manifestations O
of O

The O

and O

before O
the O
onset O
of O
clinical O
diseases O
such O
as O
atherosclerosis, O

and O

Whether O
reduced O
vascular O

precedes O
the O
development O
of O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(ie, O
is O
a O

or O
is O
the O
consequence O

established O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(ie, O
a O

is O
a O
matter O
of O
debate. O

To O
qualify O
as O
a O

the O

of O
a O
condition O
must O
increase O
the O
probability O
of O

those O
without O

(implying O
stronger O

Recent O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
ascending O
aorta O
of O
the O
aortic O
trunk O
in O
Chinese O
has O
a O
larger O
diameter O
and O
thinner O
media O
than O
that O
in O
Australians O
and O
population O
differences O
such O
as O
these O
may O
be O
genetically O
determined.2 O

have I-Comorbidity
suggested O
that O
the O
angiotensin O
II O
type O
1 O
receptor O
(AT1) O
gene O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
development O
of O
aortic O
stiffness.3 O
A O
conceptual O
example O
where O
abnormalities O
in O
vascular O
compliance O
might I-Comorbidity

both O
a O
risk O
factor O
and O
a O
marker O
is O
hypertension. O

Hypertension O
may O
alter O
arterial O
wall O
tone O
and O
structure O
increasing O
blood O
pressure, O
which O
results O
in O
a O
decrease O
in O
compliance O
(ie, I-Comorbidity

decrease O
in O
compliance O
is O
a O
marker O
for O
hypertension). O

Alternatively, O
when O
sclerotic O
changes O
occur O
in O
vessels O
arising O
from O
diseases O
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O

blood O
pressure, O
decreased O
compliance O
becomes O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
the O
development O
of O
hypertension. O

In O
the O
following O
discussions, O
it O
should O
be O
kept O
in O
mind O
that O

is O
both O
morphologic O
(structural) O
and O
functional O
heterogeneity O
in O
the O
different O
vascular O
beds. O

Also, O
there O
is O
no O
accepted O
“gold O
standard” O
methodology O
for O
estimating O
vascular O

so O
comparison O
of O
results O
obtained O
with O
differing O
methodologies O
is O
difficult O
if O
not O
impossible. O

The O
experiments O
herein O
described O
consist O
of O
some O
controls O
made O
at O
the O
commencement O
of O
an O
investigation O
of O
the O
relation O
of O
the O
adrenals O
to O
vascular O
tone. O

It O
has O
long O
been O
known O
that O
animals O
may O
survive O
the O
excision O
of O
both O

glands O
for O
one O
to O
three O
days O
or O
even O
longer, O
and O
that O
a O
low O
blood-pressure O
is O
found O
previous O
to O
the O
death O
of O
the O
animal, O
but O
the O
time O
at O
which O
such O
blood-pressure O
changes O
develop O

not O
been O
so O
carefully O
investigated. O

Hoskins O
and O
McClure O
have O
shown O

no O
fall O
of O
blood-pressure O
is O
observed O
in O
half-an-hour O
after O
the O
removal O
of O
the O
adrenals, O
and O
Young O
and O
Lehmann O
found O
no O

pressure O
for O
some O
hours. O

The O
evidence O
in O
this O
direction O
seems, O
therefore, O
to O
be O
mainly O
negative. O

Blood O
pressure O
and O
components O
of O

measured O
in O
49 O
normal O

and O
in O

untreated O

with O

Blood O
viscosity O

measured O
at O
six O
different O
shear O
rates O
were O
significantly O
correlated O
with O
blood O
pressure O
(r O
= O
0.432 O
to O
0.505, O
p O
less O
than O
0.001). O

Blood O
viscosity O
was O
higher O
in O
hypertensive O
patients. O

This O

due O
to O
both O
higher O

(44.4 O
+/- O
4 O

versus O
41.5 O

When O
blood O

was O
evaluated O
in O
subgroups O
of O
normal O

hypertensive O
subjects O
with O
matched O
hematocrit O

it O
remained O
higher O
in O
the O
hypertensive O
patients, O
and O
the O
relationship O
between O
blood O
pressure O
and O
viscosity O
was O

significant. O

Regardless O
of O
the O
hematocrit O
value, O
fibrinogen O
levels O
were O
elevated O
in O
hypertensive O
patients O
(p O
less O

and, O
in O

with O
the O
increased O

was O
largely O
responsible O
for O
the O

Since O
the O

of O
defibrinated O

was O
similar O
in O

In O
this O
paper, O
a O
terse O
review O
of O
different O
types O
of O
BP O
measuring O
techniques O
and O
devices, O
commercially O
available O
is O

along O
with O
some O
related O
important O
historical O
developments. O

A O
concise O
and O
consolidated O
report O
of O
the O
several O
existing O

calibration O
being O
used O
at O
various O

Metrology O
Institutes O
(NMIs) O
and O
other O
leading O
research O
groups O
is O
also O
included. O

This O
would O
open O
new O
lines O
for O
the O
future O
researchers O
to O
standardise O
a O
uniform O
and O
acceptable O
calibration O
method O
for O
these O

is O
need O
of O
the O
hour. O

Most O
medical O
examinations O
include O
measuring O
of O
blood O
pressure O
because O
it O
is O
a O
very O
good O
indicator O

the O
status O
of O
the O
cardiovascular O
system, O
and O
it O
helps O
medical O
doctors O
to O

the O
ideal O
treatment. O

It O
would O
be O
very O
useful O
to O
know O
the O
profile O
of O
pressure O
values O
during O
long O
time O
period, O
especially O
during O
standard O
daily O
activities. O

It O

be O
used O
for O
homecare O
monitoring O
and O
prevention O
of O
premature O
death. O

Problem O
is O
that O

pressure O
is O
monitored O
mainly O
at O
discrete O
time O
intervals O
and O
use O
an O
inflatable O
cuff O
placed O
around O
the O
arm, O
which O
is O
uncomfortable O
for O
the O
patient. O

Currently, O
there O
are O
a O
few O
technical O

for O
continuous O
non-invasive O
measurement O
of O
blood O
pressure. O

This O
review O
is O
focused O
on O
the O
description O
of O
methods O
for O
continuous O
blood O
pressure O
measurement O
including O
their O
limitations O
and O
especially O
is O
focused O
on O
the O

method O
based I-Method
on I-Method
pulse O
transit O
time. O

This O
method O
could O
be O
the O
most O
widely O
used O
of O
methods O
for I-Comorbidity
non-invasive O
long O

monitoring O
of O
blood O
pressure O
in O
the O
future O
but O
now O

are O
still O
a O
lot O
of O
unsolved O
problems. O

A O
mercury O
sphygmomanometer I-Method
(MS) O

been O
the O
gold O
standard O
for O
pediatric O
blood O
pressure O
(BP) O
measurements, O
and O
diagnosing O
hypertension O
is O
critical. O

However, O
because O
of O
environmental O
issues, O
other O
alternatives O
are O
needed. O

Noninvasive O
BP O
measurement O
devices O
are O
largely O
divided O
into O
auscultatory O

oscillometric O
types. I-Method

The O
aneroid O
sphygmomanometer, O
the O
currently O
used O
auscultatory O
method, O
is O
inferior O
to O
MS O
in O
terms O
of O
limitations O
such O
as O
validation O
and O
regular O
calibration O
and O
difficult O
to O
apply O
to O
infants, O
in O
whom O
Korotkoff O
sounds O
are O
not O
audible. O

The O
oscillometric O

uses O
an O
automatic O
device O
that O
eliminates O
errors O
caused O
by O
human O
observers O
and O
has O
the O
advantage O
of O
being O
easy O
to O
use; O
however, O
owing O
to O
its O
measurement O
accuracy O
issues, O
the O
development O
of O
an O
international O
validation O
protocol O

children O
is O
important. O

The O
hybrid O
method, O
which O
combines O
the O
auscultatory O
and O
electronic O
methods, O
solves O
some O
of O
these O
problems O
by O
eliminating O
the O
observer O
bias O

terminal O
digit O
preference O
while O
maintaining O
measurement O
accuracy; O
however, O
the O
auscultatory O
method O
remains O
limited. O

As O
the O
age-related O

of O
the O
pediatric O
group O
are O
heterogeneous, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
reconsider O
the O
appropriate O
BP O
measurement O
method O
suitable O
for O
this O
indication. O

In O
addition, O
the O
mobile O
application-based O
BP O
measurement O
market O
is O
growing O
rapidly O

the O
development O
of O
smartphone O
applications. O

Although O
more O
research O
is O

needed O
on O
their O
accuracy, O
many O
experts O
expect O
that O
mobile O
application-based O

measurement O
will O
effectively O
reduce O
medical O
costs O
due O
to O
increased O
ease O
of O
access O
and O

BP O
management. O

Background: O
Aneroid O
manometers O
are O
frequently O
used O
to O
measure O
blood O
pressure. O

Aneroid O
manometers O
have O
moving O
parts O
that O
are O
subject O
to O
fatigue. O

The O
accuracy O
duration O
of O
the O

devices, O
like O
most O
digital O
devices, O
is O
unstudied. O

It O
has O
been O
accepted O
that O
if O
the O
aneroid O
device O
does O
not O
rest O
at O
'0' O

is O
inaccurate, O
but O
how O
often O
is O
the O

when O
it O
does O

Two O
additional O
aneroid O
devices O
were O
not O

and O
250mmHg. O
Results: O
The O
average O

Conclusions: O
Aneroid O
devices O
were I-Method
accurate. O

A O
yearly O

should O
be O
performed O
and O
a O

Background: O
The O
aneroid O

despite O
significant O
concerns O
about O
its I-Method

Although O
the O

sphygmomanometer O
is O
highly O
accurate, O
there O
are O
concerns O
about O
the O
environmental O

In O
response O
to O
various O

pressures O
to O

the O
Mayo O
Clinic, O
Rochester, O
Minn, O
has O
replaced O
many O
mercury O
sphygmomanometers O
with O
aneroid O
devices. O

Since O

The I-Method
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
assess I-Method
the I-Method
accuracy O
and O
reliability O
of O
mercury O
and O
aneroid O
sphygmomanometers. O

Measurement O
of O

were O
carried O
out O
in O
524 O
sphygmomanometers, O
351 O
from O

hospital O
setting, O
and I-Method
173 I-Method
from O
private O
medical O
offices. O

Mercury O
sphygmomanometers O
were O

inaccurate O
if O
the O
meniscus O
was O
not O
'0' O
at O

Aneroid O
sphygmomanometers O
were O
tested O
against O
a O
properly O
calibrated O
mercury O
manometer, O
and O
were O
considered O
calibrated O
when I-Method
the O
error O
was O
< O

mm O
Hg. O
Both O
types O
of O
sphygmomanometers O
were O
evaluated O
for O
conditions O
of O
cuff/bladder, O

and O
valve. O

Of O
the O
mercury O
sphygmomanometers O
tested O
21 O
% O
were O
found O
to O
be O
inaccurate. O

Of O
this O
group, O
unreliability O
was O
noted O
due O
to: O
excessive O
bouncing O
(14%), O
illegibility O
of O
the O

was O
noted O
in O
10% O
of O

Although O
the O
mercury O
sphygmomanometer O
is O
widely O
regarded O
as O
the O
“gold O
standard” O
for O
office O

pressure O

the O
ban O
on O
use O
of O
mercury O
devices O
continues O
to O
diminish O
their O
role O
in O
office O
and O
hospital O
settings. O

To O
date, O

devices O
have O
largely O
been O
phased O
out O
in O
US O
hospitals. O

This O
has O
led O
to O
the O
proliferation O
of O

devices O
and O
has O
changed O
(probably O
for O
ever) O
the O
preferable O
modality O
of O
blood O

simulators O
are O
often O
subject O
to O
mechanical O
and O
electromagnetic O

which O
could O
effect O
their O

Our O

was O
to O
design O
a O
procedure O

testing O
the O
reliability O
and O
quality O
of O

in O
order O
to O
ensure O

Procedure O
for O
evaluation O
of O
NIBP O

is O


Static O
test O
consisted O
of O
procedures O
derived O
from O
common O
electro-mechanical O

calibration, O
while O
dynamic O

included O
testing O
of O
repeatability O
of O

output. O

A O
commercial O
simulator I-Location
was O
tested. O

Among O
others, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
evaluations O
of O
NIBP O
simulators O
should O
be O
performed O
regularly I-Comorbidity
with O
a O
suitable O
time O
interval O
in O
order O
to O
track O
the O
metrological O

Acceptance O
criteria O
for O
a O
reliable O
simulator O
in O

static O
and O
dynamic O
sense O
are O
proposed. O

In O
the O
last O
30 O
years, O
several O
organizations, O
such O
as O
the O
US O
Association O
for O
the O
Advancement O
of O
Medical O

(AAMI), O
the O
British O
Hypertension O
Society, O
the O
European O
Society O
of O

(ESH) O
Working O

on O
Blood O
Pressure O
(BP) O
Monitoring O
and O
the O
International O
Organization O
for O
Standardization O
(ISO) O
have O
developed O
protocols O
for O
clinical O
validation O
of O
BP O
measuring O
devices. O

However, O
it O
is O
recognized O
that O
science, O
as O
well O
as O
patients, O
consumers O
and O
manufacturers O
would O
be O
best O
served O
if O
all O
BP O
measuring O
devices O
were O
assessed O
for O
accuracy O
according O
to O
an O

single O
validation O
protocol O
that O
had O
global O
acceptance. O

Therefore, O
an O
international O
initiative O
was O
taken O
by O
AAMI, O
ESH O
and O
ISO O
experts O
who O
agreed O
to O
develop O
a O

standard O
for O
device O
validation. O

This O
statement O
presents O
the O
key O
aspects O
of O
a O
validation O
procedure, O
which O
were O
agreed O
by O
the O

ESH O
and O
ISO O
representatives O
as O
the O
basis O
for O
a O
single O
universal O
validation O
protocol. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
AAMI/ESH/ISO O
standard O
is O
fully O
developed, O
this O
will O
be O
regarded O

the O
single O

standard O
and O
will O
replace O
all O

previous O
standards/protocols. O

Blood O
pressure O
(BP) O
follows O
a O
circadian O
rhythm, O
it O
increases O
on O
waking O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
decreases O
during O
sleeping O
at O
night. O

Disruption O
of O
the O
circadian O
BP O
rhythm O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
worsened O
cardiovascular O
and O
renal O
outcomes, O
however O
the O
underlying O

mechanisms O
are O
still O
not O
clear. O

In O
this O
review, O
we O
briefly O
summarized O
the O
current O
understanding O
of O
the O
circadian O

and O
provided O
therapeutic O

(BPSM) O
requires O
patients O
to O
follow O
a O
range O
of O
recommendations O
in O
order O
to O
be O
considered O
reliable O
for O

We O
investigated O
currently O
used O
BPSM O
interventions O
at O
four O
medical O
clinics O
combined O
with O
an O
online O
questionnaire O
targeting O
BPSM O

We O
found O
that O
the O

perceived O
BPSM O
as O
a O
relevant O
and O
useful O
intervention O
method O
providing O
that O
the O

A O
total O
of O
six O
challenges O
were O
identified: O
(1) O

them, O
(4) O
risk O
of O

In O

Studies O
have O
shown O
substantial O
differences O
in O
BP O
when I-Comorbidity
measured I-Comorbidity
outside O
versus O
in O
the O
office O
setting. O

Ambulatory O
BP O
monitoring O
is O
considered O
the O
reference O
standard I-Comorbidity
for O
out-of-office O
BP O
assessment, O
with O

BP I-Comorbidity
monitoring O
being O
an O

Compared O
with O
their O

with O
sustained O

To O
interpret O

data O
appropriately, O
healthcare O
providers O
need O
to O
be O
knowledgeable O
of O
the O
factors O
that O
can O
potentially O
impact O
the O
accuracy O
of O
BP O
measurement O
and O
contribute O
to O
variability O

Methods: O
A O
systematic O
review O
of O
studies O
quantifying O
BP O
measurement O
inaccuracy. O

Medline O
and O
CINAHL O

were O
searched O
for O

published O
up O
to O
June O
2015. O

Empirical O

were O
included O
if O
they O
reported O
a O

that O
was O
relevant O
to O
the O
measurement O
of O
adult O
patients’ O
resting O

at O
the O
upper O

Results: O
A O

They O
investigated O
29 O
potential O

categorized O
as O
relating O
to O
the O

Significant O
directional O
effects O
were O

for O
27; O
however, O
for O

sources O
ranged O
from O
−23.6 O

Conclusion: O
A O
single O
BP O

should O
be O
interpreted O
with O
caution O

not O
taken O
as O

Where O
a O

further O
measurements O

be O
taken O
and O
averaged. O

Wherever O
possible, O
BP O
values O
should O
be O
recorded O
graphically O
within O
ranges. O

This O
may O
reduce O
the O

To O
determine O
the I-SBP_SLASH_DBP

the O

two O
cuff O

The O

rates O
were O

using O
a O
constant O
blood O

of O
120/80 O
mm O

and O
heart O
rates O
ranging O
from O
40 O

It O
was O
confirmed O
that O
a O
cuff O

The O

A O

introduced O
as O
a O
subject O
in O
both O
the O

The O
auscultatory O

be O
the O
method O

but O
they O
require O
frequent O

have O
promise. O

The O
oscillometric O

can O
be O
used O
for O

is O
recommended. O

They O
have O
the O
advantage O
of O
being O
able O
to O
take O
multiple O

Proper O
training O
of O
observers, O
positioning O
of O
the O
patient, O

selection O
of O

size O
are O
all O
essential. O

It O
is O
increasingly O
recognized O
that O
office O

correlate O
poorly O
with I-Comorbidity
blood I-Comorbidity

There O
is O

that O
a O
failure O
of O

to O
fall O

the O
night O
may O
be O
associated O
with O

In O
obese O
patients O
and O
children, O
the O
use O
of O
an O

is O
of O
paramount O
importance. O

Hypertension O
is O
one O
of O

Not O
only O
do O
the O
differences O
between O
the O
ovarian O
and O

hormonal O
milieu O
contribute O
to O
this O
sexual O
dimorphism O
in I-Comorbidity
blood O
pressure, O
the O
sex O
chromosomes O
also O
play O
a O
role O
in O
and O
of O
themselves. O

This O
review O
primarily O
focuses O
on O
epidemiological O
studies O
of O
blood O
pressure O
in O
men O

women O
and O
experimental O
models O
of O
hypertension O
in I-Comorbidity
both O
sexes. O

Gaps O
in O
current O
knowledge O
regarding I-Sex

underlie O
male-female O
differences O
in O
blood O
pressure O
control O
are O
discussed. O

Elucidating O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
sex O
differences O
in O
hypertension O
may O
lead O
to O
the O
development I-Sex
of O
anti-hypertensives O
tailored O

one's O
sex I-Sex
and O
ultimately O
to O
improved O
therapeutic O
strategies I-Sex
for O
treating O
this O
disease O
and O
preventing O
its I-Sex

consequences. O

Men O
are O
at O
greater O
risk O
for O
cardiovascular O
and O
renal O
disease O
than O
are O
age-matched, I-Sex
premenopausal O
women. O

Recent O
studies O
using O
the O
technique O
of O
24-hour O
ambulatory O
blood O
pressure O
monitoring O
have O
shown O
that O
blood O
pressure O
is I-Sex
higher O
in I-Sex

than O
in O
women O
at O
similar O
ages. O

After O
menopause, O
however, O
blood O
pressure O
increases I-Sex

women O
to O
levels O
even O
higher O
than O
in O
men. O

Hormone O
replacement O
therapy O
in O
most O
cases O

not O
significantly O
reduce O
blood O
pressure O
in O
postmenopausal O
women, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
loss O
of O
estrogens O
may O
not O
be O
the O
only O
component O
involved O
in O
the O
higher O
blood O
pressure O
in O
women O
after O
menopause. O

In O
contrast, O
androgens O
may O
decrease O
only O
slightly, O
if O
at O
all, O
in O
postmenopausal O
women. O

In O
this O
review O
the O
possible O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
androgens O
may O
increase O
blood O
pressure O
are O
discussed. O

Findings O
in O
animal O
studies O
show O
that O
there O
is O
a O
blunting O
of O
the O
pressure-natriuresis O
relationship O
in O
male O
spontaneously O
hypertensive O
rats O
and O

ovariectomized O
female O
spontaneously O
hypertensive O
rats O
treated I-Sex
chronically O
with I-Sex
testosterone. O

The O
key O
factor O
in O
controlling O
the O
pressure-natriuresis O
relationship O
is O
the O
renin-angiotensin O
system O
(RAS). O

The O
possibility I-Sex
that O
androgens O
increase O
blood I-Sex
pressure O
via O
the O
RAS O
is O
explored, O
and O
the O
possibility O
that O

RAS O
also O
promotes O
oxidative O
stress O
leading O
to O
production O
of O
vasoconstrictor O
substances O
and I-Sex
reduction O
in I-Sex
nitric O
oxide O
availability O
is O
proposed. O

Importance: O
If O
we O
assume O
that O
women O
and O
men O
exhibit O
variations O
of O
the O
same I-Comorbidity
fundamental I-Comorbidity

physiology, O
then O
conventional O
analyses O
of O
subclinical O
measures O
would O
suggest O
that O
women O
catch O
up O
to I-Sex
men O
by I-Sex
midlife O
in O
the O
extent O
of O
potentially O
important O
vascular O
disease. O

Alternatively, O
under O

assumption O
that O
vascular O
physiology O
may O
fundamentally O
differ O
between O
women O
and O
men, O
a O
sex-specific O
analysis O
of O
existing O
data O
could O
offer O
new O
insights O
and O
augment O
our O
understanding O
of O

in I-Location

Conclusions O
and O

In I-Sex

with O
the I-Sex

that O
important O

disease O
processes O
in O
women O
lag O
behind O
men O
by O
10 O

20 O
years, O
sex-specific O
analyses O
indicate O
that O
BP O
measures O
actually O
progress O
more O
rapidly O
in O
women O
than O
in O
men, O
beginning O
early O
in O
life. O

This O
early-onset O

dimorphism O
may O
set O
the O
stage O
for O
later-life O
cardiovascular O
diseases O
that I-Comorbidity
tend O
to O
present O
differently, O
not O
simply O
later, O
in O
women O
compared I-Comorbidity
with O
men. O

Background: O
This O
work O
aimed O
to O
explore I-Comorbidity
whether O
different O

In O
light O
of O
the O
emphasis O
on O

prevention O
of O
hypertension, O
identifying O
those O
with O
normal I-Location
BP O
who O
will O
respond O
to I-Sex
IRT O
is O
important. O

Also, O
heightened O
BP O

increases I-Sex

risk, O
and O
as O
IRT O
reduces O
BP O

in O
patients O
with O

it O
warrants O
further O
investigation O
in O
a O

Background: O
According O
to O
the O
current O
guidelines O
for O
blood O
pressure O
monitoring, O
clinicians O
are O
recommended O
to O
measure O
blood O
pressure O
by O
completely O
exposing O
the O

arm. O

However, O
it O
is O
a O
common O
practice O
that O
blood O
pressure O
is O
measured O
with O
the O
cuff O
placed O
over O

sleeve O
or O
with O
the O
sleeve O
rolled O
up. O

We O
therefore O
conducted O
this O
study O
to I-Method
examine O
whether O
there O
are O
any O

in O
blood O

measurements O
among O
the O
three O
different O
settings: O
the O

and O
the O
bare O

group. O

Methods: O
We O
conducted O
the O
current O
study O
in O
141 O
male O
and O
female O
adult O
patients O
who O
visited O
our O
clinical O
department. O

In O
these O
patients, O
we O
took O
repeatedly O
blood O
pressure O
measurements O
using O
the O
same O
automatic O
oscillometric O
device O
on O
three O
different O
settings. O

Then, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
results O

the O

Results: O
The O
mean O
values O
of O
systolic O

pressure O
(SBP) O
between O
the O
first O
reading O
and O
those O
of O
the O
second O

and O
128.3 O

These O
results O
indicate O
that O
there O
were O

the O
three O

In O
addition, O
the O

These O
results O
indicate O
that O
there O
were O
no O

among O
the O
three O

In O
addition, O
based O
on O
the O

We O
recommend O
that O

race O
is O
widely O
used O
in O
hypertension O
research O
as O
a O
marker O
of O
increased O
risk, O
its O
meaning O
as O
an O
etiologic O
quantity O
is O
obscure. O

Because O
of O
its O
importance O
as O
a O
social O
category O
in O
American O
life, O
separating O
what O
we O
“know” O
about O
race O
through O
socialization O
from O
what O
can O
be O
known O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
scientific O

is O
difficult. O

This O
dilemma O
represents O
a O
specific O
example O
of O
how O
social O
influences O
impact O
the O
conduct O
of O
science. O

While O
the O
process O
by O
which O
evidence O
is O
gathered O
and O
evaluated O
is O
usually O
constrained O
by O
an O

theoretical O
model O
(the O
“hypothetico-deductive O
process”), O
hypotheses O
arise O
more O
informally O
from O
the O
interplay O
of O
“inspiration” O
and O
“intuition.” O
Although O
hypothesis O
generation O
is O
at O
the O
core O
of O
scientific O
activity, O
it O
is O
peculiarly O
vulnerable O
to O
the O
influences O
of O
ideology. O

Contemporary O
perspectives O
on O
science O
as O

practical O
human O
activity O
thus O
acknowledge O
that O
inspiration O
and O
intuition O
are O
the O
products O
of O
imagination O
and, O
as O
such, O
are O
derived O
from O
the O
investigator’s O
experience—both O
inside O
and O
outside O
the O
laboratory. O

While O
it O
is O
necessary O

take O
account O
of O
the O
assumptions O
about O
race O
that O
are O
generated O
by O
our O
participation O
in O
a O
racially O
stratified O
society, O
it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
define O
exactly O
what O
we O
can O
know O
about O
race O
through O
the O
conduct O
of O
science. O

In O
this O
discussion, O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
moving O
beyond O
concerns O
about O
social O
influences O
on O
hypothesis O
generation I-Comorbidity
and O
will O
attempt O
to O
address O
the O
logic O
of O
studies O

use O
race O
comparisons O
to O
examine O
causal O
relationships. O

Specifically, O
we O
ask O
the O
question, O
“Can O
available O
statistical O
adjustment O
methods O
lead O
to O
valid O
inferences O
when O
race O
is O
regarded O

an O
etiologic O
quantity, O
rather O
than O
a O
broad O
indicator O
of O
risk O
factor O
status?” I-Comorbidity
Despite O
the O
popularity O
of O
racial O
hypotheses, O

argue O
that O
comparative O
studies O
based O
on O
observations O
of O
broad O
phenotypes—such O
as O
high O
blood O
pressure, O
obesity, O
or I-Comorbidity
glucose O
intolerance—have O
little O
potential O
to O
contribute O
new O
knowledge. O

The I-Comorbidity
attempt O
to O
interpret O
race O
as O
a O
causal O
entity O
founders I-Location
on I-Location
technical O
and O
logical O
flaws, O
above O
and O
beyond I-Comorbidity
the I-Comorbidity

of O
race O
as O
a O
biological O
construct. O

To O
support O
that O
assertion, O
we O
review I-Comorbidity
the I-Comorbidity
use I-Comorbidity
of O
race I-Comorbidity
in I-Comorbidity

and O
make O

We O
close O
with O
a O

for O
at I-Comorbidity
least O
one O
alternative I-Location
direction I-Location
for O
etiologic O

on O

when I-Comorbidity

wish O

Hypertension O
remains O

important O

The O

Of O

In O

The O

Background O
Several O
epidemiological O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
blood O
pressure O
changes O
with O
temperature O
based O

the O
daily O

However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O

of O
the O
relationship O
between O
temperature O
and O

Objectives O
The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O

non-linear O
relationship O
between O
hourly O
temperature O
and O
blood O

Methods O
This O
is O
a O
prospective O

study O
comprising O
100 O
participants O
in O
Suzhou, O
China. O

The O
blood O
pressure O
of O
each O
participant O
was O
measured O
>50 O
times O
between O
October O
2013 O
and O
January O

was O
used O
to O
investigate O
the O
relationship O
between O

pressure. O

Results O
We O
found O
that O
the O
relationship O
between O
hourly O
temperature O
and O
blood O
pressure O
was O
parabolic. O

Short-term O
exposure O

had O
a O
significant O

Conclusion: O
Knowledge O

Furthermore, O
knowledge O
of O
these O
factors O
associated O
with O

profile O
will O
lay O
the O
foundation O
for O
interventions O
to O
prevent/treat O
alterations O
in O

The O
non-dipping O
pattern O
of O
blood O
pressure O
(defined O
as O
a O
nocturnal O
fall O
of O
less O
than O

occurs O
in O
about O
25% O
of O
hypertensives, O
with O
increased O
prevalence O
in O
certain O
sub-groups O
such O
as O

African-Americans, O
and O
patients O
with O
renal O
disease. O

It O
almost O
certainly O
has O
multiple O
causes, O
including O
factors O
such O
as O
the O
levels O
of O

and O
arousal O
during O
both O
the O
day O
and O
the O
night, O
the O
depth O
and O
quality O
of O
sleep, O
and O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
sympathetic O
nervous O
system, O
among O
others. O

In O
patients O
with O
uncomplicated O
hypertension, O
the O
reproducibility O
is O
relatively O
low. O

There O
is O
evidence O
suggesting O
that O
the O
non-dipping O
pattern O
may O
have O
an O
adverse O
prognosis: O
thus, O
it O
appears O
to O
predict O
the O
progression O
of O
renal O
disease, O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
increased O
target-organ O

(in O
some O
studies), O
and O
also O
to O
predict O
increased O
cardiovascular O
morbidity. O

Antihypertensive O
drug O
treatment O
can O
normalize O
the O
non-dipping O
pattern, O
but O
the O
therapeutic O
consequences O
of O
this O
are O
unknown. O

Our O
objective O
was O
to O
compare O
three O
different O

of O

through O
the O
results O
of O
a O

aimed O
at O
comparing O
the O
antihypertensive O

of O
trandolapril O
and O

Two O

twenty-nine O

patients O
were O

a O

they O
received O
either O
2 O
mg O
trandolapril O
or O
50 O

once O
daily O
for O
6 O
weeks. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
both O
placebo O
and O
active O
treatment O

three O
methods O
of O
blood O
pressure O
measurement O
were O
used: O
a) O
office O
blood O
pressure O
(three O
consecutive O
measurements); O
b) O
home O
self O
blood O
pressure O
measurements O
(SBPM), O
consisting O
of O
three O
consecutive O
measurements O
performed O
at O

in O
the O
morning O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
for O
7 O
consecutive O
days; O
and O
c) O
ambulatory O
blood O
pressure O
measurements O

24-h O
BP O
recordings O
with O
three O
measurements O
per O
hour. O

Of O
the O
229 O
patients, O
199 O
(87%) O
performed O

least O
12 O
valid O
SBPM O
measurements O
during O
both O
placebo O
and O
treatment O
periods, O
whereas O
only O
160 O
(70%) O
performed O
good O
quality O
24-h O
ABPM O

during O
both O

(P O
< O
.0001). O

One O
hundred-forty O
patients O
performed O
the O

methods O
of O
measurement O
well. O

At O
baseline O
and O
with O
treatment, O
agreement O
between O
office O
measurements O
and O
ABPM O
or O
SBPM O
was O
weak. O

Conversely, O
there O
was O
a O
good O
agreement O
between O
ABPM O
and O
SBPM. O

The O
mean O
difference O
(SBP/DBP) O
between O
ABPM O
and O
SBPM O
was O
4.6 O
+/- O
10.4/3.5 O
+/- O
7.1 O
at O
baseline O
and O
3.5 O
+/- O
10.0/4.0 O

7.0 O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
treatment O
period. O

The O
correlation O
between O
SBPM O
and O
ABPM O
expressed O
by O
the O
r O
coefficient O
and O
the O
P O
values O
were O
the O
following: O
at O
baseline O
0.79/0.70 O
(< O

.0001), O
with O
active O
treatment O
0.74/0.69 O
(0.0001/.0001). O

Hourly O
and I-Location
24-h O
reproducibility O
of O
blood O
pressure O
response I-Comorbidity
was I-Comorbidity
quantified O
by O
the O
standard O
deviation O
of O

response. O

Compared O
with O
office I-Comorbidity
blood O
pressure, O
both O
global O
and O
hourly O
SBPM O
responses O
exhibited O
a O
lower O
standard O
deviation. O

Hourly O

of O
SBPM O
response O
(10.8 O
mm O

was O
lower O
than O
hourly O
reproducibility O
of O
ABPM O
response O
(15.6 O
mm O
Hg/11.9 O
mm O

In O
conclusion, O
SBPM O
was O
easier O
to O
perform O
than O
ABPM. O

There O
was O
a O
good O
agreement O
between O
these O
two O
methods O
whereas O
concordance O
between O
SBPM O
or O
ABPM O
and O

measurements O
was O
weak. O

As O
hourly O
reproducibility O
of O
SBPM O
response O
is O
better O
than O
reproducibility O
of O
both O
hourly O
ABPM O
and O
office O

SBPM O
seems O
to O

the O
most O
appropriate O
method O
for O

Objective: O
The O

The O

Conclusion: O
A O
higher O

This O

Blood O
pressure O
(BP) O
varies O
according O
to O

internal O
and O
external O
factors, O
and O
behavioral O
factors O
have O

important O
role O
in O
diurnal O
BP O
variation. O

BP O
rises O
sharply O
on O
waking O
in O
the O
morning O
and O

during O
sleep O
at O
night, O
although O
it O
varies O
throughout O
the O
day O
and O
night. O

These O
changes O
in O
BP O
are O
closely O
related O
to O
mental O
and O
physical O
activities, O
and O
the O
sympathetic O
nervous O
system O
mainly O
contributes O
to O
the O
diurnal O
variation O
in O
BP. O

Other O
behavioral O
factors, O
such O
as O
food O
consumption O
and O

dietary O
intake I-SBP_SLASH_DBP
of O
sodium, O
drinking O
and O
smoking O
habits, O
consumption O
of O
coffee O
and O
tea, O
and O
bathing, O
also O
affect O
the O
diurnal O
variation O
in O
BP. O

Alterations O
in O
diurnal O
BP O
variation O
due O
to O
behavioral O

are O
frequently O
seen O
in O

can O
be O
classified O
as O
morning O
hypertension, O
daytime O

Appropriate O

both O
the O
level O

of O
BP O
in O
these O

the O

that O

recommended O
as O
the O
first-step O
approach O
to O
the O
management O
of O
hypertension O
by O
all O
national O
and O
international O
guidelines. O

Today, O
when O
considering O
nutritional O
factors O
in O
hypertension, O
almost O
all O
the O
attention O
is O
focused O
on O
the O
reduction O
of O
salt O
intake O
to I-Comorbidity
improve I-Comorbidity
blood I-Comorbidity
pressure O
(BP) O


Changes I-Comorbidity
in O
potassium O
intake O
are O
only O
briefly O
evoked O
in O
guidelines. O

Few O
physicians O
actually O
think I-Comorbidity
about O
proposing O
to O
eat O

foods O
that O
are O
high O
in O
potassium O
(fruits, O
vegetables, O
nuts) O
to O
better O
control O
BP. O

Yet, O
during O
the O

40 O
years, O
increasing O
evidence O
has O
accumulated O
demonstrating O
that O
increasing O
potassium O
intake, O
either O
with O
food O
products O
or O
with O
supplements, O
is O
associated O
with O
significant O
reductions O
of O
both O
systolic O
and O
diastolic I-Comorbidity
BP. O

The O
hypotensive O
effect O
of O
potassium I-Comorbidity
is O
particularly O
marked I-Comorbidity

patients O
with O
hypertension O
and O
in O
subjects O
with O
a I-Comorbidity
very I-Comorbidity
high O
sodium O
intake, O
suggesting O
that O
potassium O
counterbalances O
the O
effects O
of O
sodium. O

In O
addition, O
several O

have O
now O
confirmed O
that O
high O
potassium O
intake O
reduces O
the O
risk O
of O
stroke O
by O
∼ O
25%. O

Finally, O
increasing O
potassium O
in O
the O
diet O
may O
perhaps O
be O
beneficial O
for O
some O

patients, O
as I-Sex
post O
hoc O
analyses O
have O
suggested O
that O
a O
high O
potassium O
intake O
may O
retard O
the O
decline O

renal O
function O
in O
patients O
with O
early O
chronic O
kidney O
disease O
(CKD) O
stages. O

However, O
high O
potassium O
intake O
may O
be O
risky O
and O
sometimes O
even O
dangerous O
in O
hypertensive O
patients O

CKD O
stages O
3-5, O
specifically O
diabetics. O

In O
this O
context, O
however, O
as O
the O
level I-Comorbidity
of O
evidence I-Comorbidity

low, O
more O
prospective O
clinical O
studies O
are O
needed. O

The O
goal O
of O
this O
review O
is O
to O
discuss O
the O
actual O
evidence O
that O
supports O
the O
recommendation O
to O
eat O
more O
potassium O
in O
order O
to O
better O
control O
BP O
in O
essential O
hypertension O
and O
to O
review O
the O
restrictions O
in O
CKD O
patients O

This O
is O
the O
first O
study O
to O
demonstrate O
that O
acute O

of O
relatively O
small O

reduces O
arterial O

(for O
approximately O
60 O

Our O
data O
also O
suggest O
that O
the O
reduction O
in O
arterial O

by O
ingestion O
of O
beer O
is O
largely O
attributable O
to O
the O
effects O
of O

been O
encouraged O
to O
consume I-SBP

In O

rapidly O
following O
several O

For O

Both O
the O

Epidemiological O

show O
that O
adverse O

peak O
in O
the O
morning O

between O
6 O
AM O
and O
noon) O
and O
that O
shift O

is O
associated O
with O
cardiovascular O
disease, O
obesity, O
and O
diabetes. O

The O
endogenous O
circadian O
timing O
system O
modulates O
certain O
cardiovascular O
risk O
markers O
to O
be O
highest O
(e.g., O
cortisol, O

control, O
and O

or O
to O
respond O
most O
unfavorably O
to O
stressors O
such O
as O
exercise O
(e.g., O
epinephrine, O
norepinephrine, O
and O
vagal O
cardiac O
modulation) O
at O
an O
internal O
body O
time O
corresponding O
to O
the O

of O
day O
when O
adverse O

events O
most O

occur. O

This O
indicates O
that O
the O
circadian O
timing O
system O
and O
its O
interaction O
with O
external O
cardiovascular O
stressors O
(e.g., O
physical O

could O
contribute O
to O
the O

peak O
in O

cardiovascular O
events. O

Moreover, O
circadian O
misalignment O
and O
simulated O

work O

adverse O
effects O
on O
cardiovascular O
and O

function. O

This O
suggests O
that O
misalignment O
between O
the O
behavioral O
cycle O
and O
the O
circadian O
timing O
system O
in O
shift O
workers O
contributes O
to O
that O

In O
the O
past O
decade, O
it O
has O
become O
increasingly O
evident O
that O
the O
circadian O
clock O
system O
plays O

important O
role O
in O
many O
physiological O
processes. O

The O
circadian O
clock O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
2 O
parts: O
the O
central O
clock, O
residing O
in O
the O
suprachiasmatic O
nucleus O
of O
the O
hypothalamus, O
which O
receives O

cues, O
and O
the O
peripheral O
clocks O
that O
reside O
in O
various O
tissues O
throughout O
the O
body. O

The O
peripheral O
clocks O
play O
an O
integral O
and I-Comorbidity
unique I-Comorbidity
role O
in O
each O
of O
their O
respective O
tissues, O

the O
circadian O
expression O
of O
specific O
genes O
involved O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
physiological O
functions. O

The O
goal O
of O
this O
review O
is O
to O
provide O
an I-Comorbidity
introduction O
to O
and O
overview O
of O
the O
peripheral O
clocks, O
including O
potential O
mechanisms, O
targets, O
and O

for O

states. O

The O
peripheral O

Human O
circadian O

is O
driven O
by O
a O
circadian O
clock O

of O
two O
distinct O
components: O
the O
central O
clock, O
located O
in O
the O
suprachiasmatic O
nucleus O
(SCN) O
within O
the O
hypothalamus, O
and O
the O
peripheral O
clocks, O
located O
in O
almost O

tissues O
and O
organ O
systems O
in O
the O
body. O

Entrainment, O
or O
alignment, O
of O
circadian O
rhythmicity O
is O
dependent O
upon O
time O
of O

Additionally, O
the O
impact O

Hemodynamic O

The O

may O
increase O

The O
current O

may O
have O
a O
profound O
impact O
on O
the O
epidemiology O
of O

as O
changes O
in O
the O

may O

affect O

especially O
in O
those O
with O

Furthermore, O

In O

we O
discuss O
the O
impact O
of O

on O

and O
discuss O
how O
this O

Clinic O

known O
to O
change O
according O
to O
seasonal O
influences. O


therefore O
examined O
home O
and O
24 O
h O
ambulatory O
blood O
pressure O
values O
to O
determine O
whether O
these O
measurements O
are O
also O

by O
the O
seasons. O

In O
2051 O
subjects O
of O
the O
Pressione O
Arteriose O
Monitorate O
E O
Loro O
Associazioni O
(PAMELA) O
study, O
we I-Comorbidity
measured I-Comorbidity

(sphygmomanometric O
measurements), O
home O
(semi-automatic O
device) O
and O
ambulatory O
(Spacelabs O
90207) O
systolic O
blood O
pressure, O
diastolic O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate. O

Because O
the O
overall O
sample O
was O
evenly O
distributed O
over O
each O
month O
(except O
August), O
we O
were O
able O
to O
make O

cross-sectional O
determination O
of O
whether O
the O
values O
differed O
between O
seasons. O

The O
corresponding O
heart O
rates O
were O
also O


As O
expected, O
summer O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
lowest O
clinic O
blood O
pressure O
and O
winter O
with O
the O
highest, O
and O
this O
was O
the O
case O
also O
for O

and O
24 O
h O
average O
blood O
pressure, O
although O
seasonal O
differences O
in O
the O
latter O
were O
less O
pronounced. O

Seasonal O

home O
and O
ambulatory O
blood O

were O
similar O
for O
normotensive O
subjects O
(n O

1152), O
untreated O
hypertensives O
(n O
= O
540) O
and O
treated O
hypertensives O
(n O
= O
359). O

Heart O
rate O
values O
did O
not O
differ O
by O


Seasonal O
influences O
on O
blood O
pressure O
are O
not O
limited O
to O
conventional O
measurements O
but O
characterize O
daily O
values O
as O
well. O

These O
effects O
are O
visible O
in O
both O
normal O
and O
elevated O

pressure O

regardless O
of O
the O

of O

This O
has O
implications O

and O
for O

aimed O
at O
evaluating O
the O
effects O
of O
antihypertensive O

The O

of O
this O

to O

It O
is O
a O
standard O
practice O
to O
measure O
non-invasive O
blood O
pressure O
(NIBP) O
in O
the O
perioperative O

In O
our O
study, O
blood O
pressure O
(BP) O
was O
measured O
in O
the O
arm O
and O
calf O
preoperatively O
with O
an O
aim O
to O
determine O
whether O
there O
was O
any O
correlation O
between O
the O
two. O

This O
was O
done O
so O
that O
the O
surgeries O

which O
upper O
arm O
could O
not O
be O
used O
for O
measurement O
of O
BP O
intraoperatively, O
the O
calf O
could O
be O
used O
as O

alternative O
site. O

For O
instance, O
in O
patients O
undergoing O
mastectomy, O
one O
arm O
is O
available O
for O
intravenous O
(i.v) O
cannulation O
and O
NIBP O
measurement, O
which O
leads O
to O
repeated O
occlusion O
of O
the O
i.v. O
line. O

In O
patients O
with O
polytrauma, O
amputated O
arm, O

and O
multiple O
i.v. O
lines, O
as O
in O
patients O
with O
shock, O
neither O
arm O
is O
available O
for O
BP O
monitoring. O

The O
aim O
of O
the O

was O
to O

test O
whether O

Blood O

measured O
three O

for O
245 O
subjects O
(171 O

The O

The O

49 O
subjects O
(41 O

the O
sequence O

Because O
there O
was O
no O
systematic O

the O
three O

the O
averages O

three O
blood O

with O
subjects I-Position

and O
the O

of O
age, O
body O

and O

on O
the O

examined. O

We O
found O
no O

We O

The O
sitting O
minus O

differences O
for O
diastolic O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
decreased O
significantly O
with O
increasing O

(P< O

We O
found O
no O
effect O
of O

The O
subject's O
body I-Position

influenced O
especially O
the O

heart O
rate, O
both O

This O

choice O
of O
the O
appropriate O
cuff O
in O
obese O

depends O
not O
only O
on O

arm O
circumference O
but O
also O
on O
its O
shape O
because O
a O
conically O

arm O
makes O
it O
difficult O
to O
fit O
the O

When O
a O

an O

is O

to O
occur O
with O
BP O

that O
may O
be O
as O

as O

With O
the O
advent O
of O

the O
choice O
of O
the O

became O
even O
more O
controversial O
because O
with O

the O

the O

To O
overcome O
the O
problem O
of O

in O
obese O
individuals, O
special O
cuffs O
that O
can O
accommodate O
a O
wide O
range O
of O

have O
been O
designed. O

Using O
these O

can O

obtained O
over O

and, O

random O

in O
the O

of O
a O

Results: O
Overall, O
systolic O
BP O
(SBP) O
and O
diastolic O
BP O
(DBP) O
decreased O
by O
11.6 O
and O
4.3 O
mm O

during O
the O
chair-seated O
rest; O
only O
a O
1.8–mm O
Hg O
decrease O
in O
SBP O
was O
observed O
in O
the O

supine O
study. O

The O
chair-seated O
fall O
in O
BP O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
decrease O
in O
systemic O

in O
the O

From O
the O

SBP O
and O
DBP O
decrements, O
a O
half-time O
of O
5.8 I-DBP

respectively, O
was O
calculated. O

Decrements O
in O
SBP, O
but O
not O
DBP, O
were O
inversely O
related O
to O

corresponding O
baseline O

Conclusions: O
In O
untreated O

a O

Because O

it O

that O

Blood O

one O

in O

For O
years, O
the O

have O
been O
the O
gold O

for O

During O

the O

have O
made O

However, O
the O
discontinuous O
nature, O
the O
inability O
to O

with O
mobile O
applications, O
the O
relative O

Methods: O

Results: O
The O

In O

two O

It O
is O

It O

In O
the O
last O

technology O
has O
been O
widely O
studied O
because O
it O
could O

applied O
to O
a O
wearable O

Electrocardiography O
(ECG), O
photo-plethysmography O
(PPG), O
and O
phonocardiography O
are O
always O
used O
to O
detect O
the O
pulse O

(PTT) O
because O
the O

In O
this O

the O

replaced O

the O

(IPG) O

was O
used O
to O

The O
placement O

were O
discussed. O

Then, O
we O
designed O

IPG O

that O

Twenty O

The O

after O

were O
evaluated O
through O
the O

The O
results O
showed O
that O
the O

Moreover, O
the O

would O
be O
more O
suitable O
to O

the O

Methods: O
In O
this O
paper, O
a O
new O
method O
for O
estimating O
the O
Mean O
Arterial O
Pressure O
(MAP), O
Diastolic O
Blood O
Pressure O
(DBP) O
and O
Systolic O
Blood O
Pressure O
(SBP) O
is O

using O
only O
the O
PPG O
signal O
regardless O
of O
its O
shape O
(appropriate O
or O
inappropriate). O

Our O
proposed O
algorithm O
called O
whole-based, O
uses O
raw O
values O
of O
the O
PPG O
signal O
at O

given O
time O
interval O
for O
estimating O
the O
BP. O

In O
other O
algorithms O
called O
parameter-based, O
use O
features O
which O
are O
extracted O
from O
PPG O
signals O
in O
time O
or O
frequency O
domain. O

These O
features O
related O
to O
precise O
spotting O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
PPG O


In O
fact, O
compared O
to O
parameter-based O
methods, O
our O
algorithm O
is O
independent O
of O
the O
form O

the O
PPG O
signal. O

Results: O
Using O
the O
proposed O
algorithm, O
our O
results O
are O
completely O
met O
by O
the O
Association O
for O
the O
Advancement O
of O
Medical O
Instrumentation O
(AAMI) O
standard O
for O
both O
MAP O
and O

estimations. O

The O
results O
are O
also O
very O
close O
to O
the O
standard O
boundary O
with O
an O
average O
error O
close O
to O
zero O
for O
SBP O
estimation. O

Also, O
according O
to O
the O
British O
Hypertension O

(BHS) O
standard, O
the O
proposed O
algorithm O
for O
DBP O
estimation O
got O
grade O
A, O
whereas O
it O
got O
grade O
B O
for O
estimation O
of O
MAP O
and O
got I-Location
approximately O
grade O

for O
SBP O
estimation. O

Conclusion: O
The O
results O
demonstrate O
the O
applicability O

the O
proposed O
algorithm O
in O
estimating O
BP O
noninvasively, O
cuff-less, O
calibration-free, O
and O
only O
by O
using O
the O
appropriate O
or O
inappropriate O
PPG O
signal. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
the O

It O
is O
equally O
important O
to O

In O
